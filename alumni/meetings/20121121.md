    and other expenses.

  to be paid for by our bank account.

## Upcoming Events
### Ski Trip - 21 Dec to 23 Dec (Tentative)
+ Seven Springs, PA, 45 minutes from Wisp.
+ Weekend before Christmas. 21 Dec to 23 Dec.
+ $1200 to #1300 for a six-person condo
+ Friday to Sunday.
+ There is interest for 6 people.
+ Br. Holly Bennett would like to open up the event to non-Triangles.
+ Holly, Paul, Aaron, and some others are interested. If we have more
  than 6, we'll need to find a bigger place.

### Convention - 23-27 July 2013, Irvine, CA
+ Br. Andrew Curry volunteered to go. 
  + Br. Eric Gernat has seconded my volunteer.
+ He will pay all costs if necessary.

### Skeet Shooting event ???
+ Br. Ryan Jordan has suggested a future skeet shooting event.
+ Needs to gauge interest.
+ If we bring our own weapons and ammo, it's much cheaper.
+ We'd need to get some good interest; cost can be above $100 per
  person.
+ Various packages are available; they pay for everything, including
  targets and attendants.
+ We can also go to a shooting range, depending on whether the range is
  part of a gun club that requires membership or sponsorship.

### Alumni-themed event
+ Suggested by Br. Eric Gernat. 
+ Like a social, but a more open event that is just more social that is
  not centered around a specific activity.
+ A BBQ next spring or summer.
+ We can host a Brothers + SOs social event.
+ Memorial Day BBQ, renting a park, pavilion, or other venue.
+ Br. Eric Gernat will help organize with financial assistance from
  folks interested to attend.

### Camping Trip
+ Discussion occurred in the past, but a location is hard to find.
+ Committee Chair tabled until interest-gathering email is sent to
  Alumni list.

## Next meeting - sometime in January - location TBD

Meeting adjourned at 8:40pm.
